# Password-Strength-Analysis-Security-Best-Practices

## Objective
Understand what makes a password strong and test it against password strength tools.

## Tools
- Online password strength checkers (e.g., passwordmeter.com)
- Custom Java password strength checker

## Procedure
1. Created multiple passwords with varying complexity (simple, mixed case, with numbers, with symbols, long and complex).
2. Tested each password on an online password strength checker.
3. Created and tested different passwords on the custom Java password strength checker.
4. Collected scores and feedback from both tools.
5. Analyzed results to identify best practices.
6. Researched common password attacks (brute force, dictionary).
7. Summarized how password complexity affects security.

## Observations
- Longer passwords with mixed case, numbers, and symbols scored highest.
- Predictable patterns (e.g., "Password123!") were flagged as weak despite appearing complex.
- Both tools showed consistent results in categorizing very weak and very strong passwords.

## Key Learnings
- Use at least 12 characters.
- Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid dictionary words and common patterns.
- Randomness increases resistance to brute force and dictionary attacks.
- Refrain from reusing passwords across accounts.

## Outcome
Gained a clear understanding of password security, how different factors impact strength, and how complexity can reduce vulnerability to attacks.
